Ursa Lumi is heavily based on [Robin2010][Robin2010].

The local galaxy is split into four sections, the thin disc, the thick disk, the halo and the outer bulge.

For the initial generation, each of the sections is subdivided into cubic cells with edges of 15pc (this may change!).

# Initial Generation for Thin Disk

# Initial Generation for Thick Disk

# Initial Generation for Halo

# Initial Generation for Outet Bulge
